Standard Rules: 
-Regular 3x3 tick tack toe game. First player to achieve three continuous spaces wins
Enhanced Rules: 
-The game is setup in a 3x3 grid full of smaller 3x3 grids.
-The game begins with the first player choosing a board, and then a space on that board
-Each subsequent placement will be in the board corresponding to where the previous player made their small-board move.
 For example, player one makes a move in board 2, space 3. Player two will then make their move in any open space in board 3.
-When a player successfully achieves a regular tick tack toe victory via winning 3 continous boards in the larger grid, that player wins
